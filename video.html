  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I was born in India amidst the turmoil and economic instability within the family, we recently moved to the city. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology at Alliance University.
I have always been amused and intrigued working with the Embedded Systems from my teenage, a few projects that I worked on are Soil Moisture Monitor, Humidity, Temperature Monitoring System, Public Transport Tracker.

I'm a professional in the field of Ubiquitous Computing. I am passionate about Ambient Intelligence. Talking about Ambient Intelligence, I'm currently working on an Indoor temperature monitoring and controlling application that controls the room temperature based on the statistics of daily variations in Human internal body temperature with respect to time; in essence Humans spend most of their time indoors and the body temperature fluctuates according to the individuals Health conditions, the data of internal body temperature and heat loss from the body is used to control the room temperature.
I completed the course on Practical Time Series Analysis offered by the State University of New York with a financial aid from Coursera to gain the knowledge about time series analysis. I mastered LUA programming for my Embedded Systems through several online platforms for creating the sensor network capable of collecting, processing and sending data and ultimately communicating as a means to adapt to the data's context and activity.
